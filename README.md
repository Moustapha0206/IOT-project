# BBQ Cooler Monitoring System

## 1. Project Summary
This project aims to enhance the experience of using a cooler during barbecues by integrating basic sensor and actuator technologies for smarter monitoring and interaction. The main objective is to implement a system that provides feedback on the cooler’s conditions and actions in real time, ensuring food and drinks stay fresh while adding a layer of convenience and fun to outdoor gatherings.

We will use a DHT-11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to monitor the humidity levels inside the cooler. Maintaining proper humidity is crucial for preserving certain foods and preventing ice from melting too quickly. A DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor will be employed to accurately measure the internal temperature, ensuring that the cooler remains within a safe range for perishable items. Additionally, an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module will detect whether the lid is properly closed or open, helping to maintain optimal internal conditions.

For actuators, an LED will serve as a visual indicator when both temperature and humidity are within ideal ranges. This quick visual cue allows users to know at a glance that their cooler is performing well. Meanwhile, a buzzer will activate whenever the lid is opened or closed, providing an audible alert to minimize accidental prolonged exposure to outside air, helping to conserve the cooler’s internal environment.

This practical and interactive system demonstrates real-world sensor and actuator applications in a fun, useful way, making it a perfect project for hobbyists, students, and barbecue enthusiasts alike.
